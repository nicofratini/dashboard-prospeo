## Understanding Quantum Computing

Quantum computing represents a paradigm shift in computational power, leveraging the principles of quantum mechanics to solve complex problems that classical computers find impossible. Unlike traditional bits that exist in a state of either 0 or 1, quantum bits (qubits) can exist in multiple states simultaneously through superposition.

    ### Superposition
    Qubits can exist in multiple states simultaneously, enabling parallel processing at an unprecedented scale. This fundamental property allows quantum computers to perform certain calculations exponentially faster than classical computers.
